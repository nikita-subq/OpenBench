> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OpenBench** is the evolution of **SDBench**, originally introduced in the paper *["SDBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Speaker Diarization"](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2025/durmus25_interspeech.html)*. While SDBench focused specifically on speaker diarization, OpenBench has expanded to encompass a broader range of speech processing tasks and is designed to accommodate future modalities beyond speech.

`OpenBench` is an open-source benchmarking framework for speech processing systems. Originally focused on speaker diarization (as SDBench), the framework has evolved to support comprehensive evaluation of:

- **Speaker Diarization**: Identifying "who spoke when" in audio recordings
- **Speech Transcription**: Converting speech to text (ASR)
- **Orchestration**: Combined diarization and transcription systems
- **Streaming Transcription**: Real-time speech-to-text
- **Future Extensions**: Designed to accommodate additional speech tasks and potentially other modalities

The primary objective is to promote standardized, reproducible, and continuous evaluation of open-source and proprietary speech processing systems across on-device and server-side implementations.

Key features include:
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Easy-to-use CLI for evaluation, inference, and exploration
- Simple interface to wrap your diarization, ASR, or ASR + diarization system
- Easily accessible and extensible metrics following `pyannote` standard metric implementations
- Modular and convenient configuration management through `hydra`
- Out-of-the-box `Weights & Biases` logging
- Availability of 13+ commonly used datasets (Original dataset license restrictions apply)

> [!TIP]
> Want to add your own diarization, ASR, or orchestration pipeline? Check out our [Adding a New Diarization Pipeline](#adding-a-new-diarization-pipeline) section for a step-by-step guide!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before getting started, please note that some datasets in our [Datasets](#datasets) section require special access or have license restrictions. While we provide dataset preparation utilities in `common/download_dataset`, you'll need to procure the raw data independently for these datasets. See the dataset table for details on access requirements.

## Results

For comprehensive benchmark results across all supported tasks, please see [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Distribute SpeakerKit CLI for reproduction
- [ ] Living Benchmark, running every other month

## SpeakerKit Reproduction

If you want to reproduce `SpeakerKit` benchmark values please contact to get access to a CLI and an api-key [speakerkitpro@argmaxinc.com](mailto:speakerkitpro@argmaxinc.com).

If you already have access please update the `speakerkit.yaml` and follow the rest of instructions to setup the environment and run evals

## Setting up the environment
<details>
<summary> Click to expand </summary>

In order to get started, first make sure you have `uv` installed. The [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) has instructions for how to install the `uv` CLI.

If you already have `uv` installed you can run `make setup` to install the dependencies and set up the environment.
If you use `conda` or `venv` directly to manage your python environment you can install uv with `pip install uv` and then run `make setup` to install the dependencies.

Example with `conda`:
```bash
conda create -n <your-env-name> python=3.11
conda activate <your-env-name>
pip install uv
make setup
```

Alternatively, you can use `uv` directly to manage the environment:
```bash
# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync

# Activate the environment (if needed)
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
</details>

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Datasets
<details>
<summary> Click to expand </summary>

OpenBench supports different types of pipelines (Diarization, Transcription, Orchestration, and Streaming Transcription) with specific dataset schemas for each task type.

### Diarization Datasets

The benchmark suite uses several speaker diarization datasets that are stored on the HuggingFace Hub. You can find all the datasets used in our evaluation in this [collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/argmaxinc/diarization-datasets-67646304c9b5e2cf9720ec48). The datasets available in the aforementioned collection are:

### Additional Dataset Collections

For other pipeline types, additional dataset collections are available:

- **[Transcription Datasets](https://huggingface.co/collections/argmaxinc/speech-to-text-datasets-687e885d80f794ec4b15d66d)**: Speech-to-text datasets compatible with transcription pipelines
- **[Orchestration Datasets](https://huggingface.co/collections/argmaxinc/diarized-speech-to-text-datasets-687fb17472f844e89a9ce98a)**: Diarized speech-to-text datasets for orchestration pipelines

From these datasets `voxconverse` and `ami` are not present as download options as they were already present in the HuggingFace Hub uploaded by [diarizers-community](https://huggingface.co/diarizers-community).

**Note**: You can use `openbench-cli summary` to see all available pre-registered datasets and their compatibility with different pipeline types.

### Dataset Schemas

OpenBench supports different pipeline types, each requiring specific dataset schemas:

#### Diarization Pipeline Schema
**Required columns:**
- `audio`: Audio column containing:
  - `array`: Audio waveform as numpy array of shape `(n_samples,)`
  - `sampling_rate`: Sample rate as integer
- `timestamps_start`: List of `float` containing start timestamps of segments in seconds
- `timestamps_end`: List of `float` containing end timestamps of segments in seconds
- `speakers`: List of `str` containing speaker IDs for each segment

**Optional columns:**
- `uem_timestamps`: List of tuples `[(start, end), ...]` containing Universal Evaluation Map (UEM) timestamps for evaluation

#### Transcription Pipeline Schema
**Required columns:**
- `audio`: Audio column containing:
  - `array`: Audio waveform as numpy array of shape `(n_samples,)`
  - `sampling_rate`: Sample rate as integer
- `transcript`: List of strings containing the words in the transcript

**Optional columns:**
- `word_timestamps_start`: List of `float` containing start timestamps for each word in seconds
- `word_timestamps_end`: List of `float` containing end timestamps for each word in seconds

#### Orchestration Pipeline Schema
**Required columns:**
- `audio`: Audio column containing:
  - `array`: Audio waveform as numpy array of shape `(n_samples,)`
  - `sampling_rate`: Sample rate as integer
- `transcript`: List of strings containing the words in the transcript
- `word_speakers`: List of strings containing speaker IDs for each word

**Optional columns:**
- `word_timestamps_start`: List of `float` containing start timestamps for each word in seconds
- `word_timestamps_end`: List of `float` containing end timestamps for each word in seconds

**Validation rules:**
- `word_speakers` and `transcript` must have the same length
- If `word_timestamps_start` and `word_timestamps_end` are provided, they must have the same length as `transcript`

#### Streaming Transcription Pipeline Schema
**Required columns:**
- `audio`: Audio column containing:
  - `array`: Audio waveform as numpy array of shape `(n_samples,)`
  - `sampling_rate`: Sample rate as integer
- `text`: String containing the reference transcript

**Optional columns:**
- `word_detail`: List of dictionaries containing word-level information with `start` and `stop` timestamps in samples (will be converted to seconds)

**Note**: Currently, most available datasets are optimized for diarization tasks. For transcription, orchestration, and streaming transcription pipelines, you may need to prepare additional annotations or use datasets that include the required fields for each task type.

### Local Datasets

OpenBench supports loading datasets from local directories, which is useful for:
- Datasets that cannot be uploaded to HuggingFace Hub due to privacy/licensing restrictions
- Custom datasets you've prepared locally
- Testing with small local datasets

#### Local Dataset Structure

Local datasets should follow this directory structure:

```
dataset_dir/
├── audio/              # Audio files named by audio_id (e.g., sample_001.wav)
├── reference/          # JSON files with same names as audio (e.g., sample_001.json)
│                       # Each JSON file contains a dict with columns matching the expected schema
│                       # Example for diarization:
│                       #   {"timestamps_start": [0.0, 5.2, ...], 
│                       #    "timestamps_end": [5.2, 10.5, ...], 
│                       #    "speakers": ["SPEAKER_00", "SPEAKER_01", ...]}
│                       # Example for transcription:
│                       #   {"transcript": ["hello", "world", ...]}
├── splits/             # Split definitions (train.txt, test.txt, validation.txt)
│   └── test.txt        # Each line contains an audio_id (without extension)
└── metadata.json       # Optional: {audio_id: {extra_info_fields}}
                        #   Example: {"sample_001": {"language": "en", "dictionary": [...]}}
```

#### Reference JSON File Format

Each reference JSON file should contain a dictionary where:
- **Keys** match the expected columns for the dataset type (except `audio`, which comes from audio files)
- **Values** are the data that `prepare_sample()` expects

For example, a diarization reference file (`sample_001.json`) should contain:
```json
{
  "timestamps_start": [0.0, 5.2, 10.5],
  "timestamps_end": [5.2, 10.5, 15.8],
  "speakers": ["SPEAKER_00", "SPEAKER_01", "SPEAKER_00"],
  "uem_timestamps": [[0.0, 15.8]]  // Optional
}
```

A transcription reference file should contain:
```json
{
  "transcript": ["hello", "world", "how", "are", "you"],
  "word_timestamps_start": [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0],  // Optional
  "word_timestamps_end": [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5],    // Optional
  "language": "en",  // Optional, goes to extra_info
  "dictionary": ["hello", "world"]  // Optional, goes to extra_info
}
```

#### Using Local Datasets

To use a local dataset, simply pass the directory path as the `dataset_id` in your `DatasetConfig`:

```python
from openbench.dataset.dataset_base import DatasetConfig
from openbench.dataset.dataset_diarization import DiarizationDataset

# Local dataset - just use a path!
config = DatasetConfig(
    dataset_id="downloaded_datasets/earnings21",  # Path to local dataset directory
    split="test"
)

# Works exactly the same as HuggingFace datasets
dataset = DiarizationDataset.from_config(config)
```

The system automatically detects if `dataset_id` is a local directory path (by checking if it exists and is a directory) and loads it accordingly. If it's not a local path, it treats it as a HuggingFace dataset ID.

#### Supported Audio Formats

The local dataset loader supports common audio formats:
- `.wav` (preferred)
- `.flac`
- `.mp3`
- `.m4a`

The loader will automatically detect the audio file format by trying these extensions in order.

### Downloading Datasets

If you want to reproduce the exact dataset downloads and processing, you can use our dataset downloading scripts. First, make sure you have the required dependencies installed as mentioned in the `Getting Started` section and also install the `dataset` dependencies doing `uv sync --group dataset`

After installing the dependencies, you can run the dataset downloading script at `common/download_dataset.py`. For example, to download the ICSI meetings dataset, you can run:

```bash
uv run python common/download_dataset.py --dataset icsi-meetings --hf-repo-owner <your-huggingface-username>
```

This will download the dataset and store locally at `raw_datasets/icsi-meetings` directory and upload it to the designated HuggingFace organization at `<your-huggingface-username>/icsi-meetings`. In case you only want to download and not push to HuggingFace, you can use the `--generate-only` flag.

For simplicity if you want to download all the datasets you can run:

```bash
# This will download all the datasets and store them in the raw_datasets directory
# Will not push to HuggingFace
make download-datasets
```

### NOTE:
- For datasets requiring Hugging Face access, make sure you have your `HF_TOKEN` environment variable set
- For the `American Life Podcast` dataset, you'll need Kaggle API credentials in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
- For [`Callhome`](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2001S97) and [`Dihard-III`](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2022S14) you need to acquire the datasets from LDC first and then set their paths in the following env variables:
    - `DIHARD_DATASET_DIR` if not specified it will assume the directory lives at `~/third_dihard_challenge_eval/data`
    - `CALLHOME_AUDIO_ROOT` if not specified it will assume the directory lives at `~/callhome/nist_recognition_evaluation/r65_8_1/sid00sg1/data`
- The downloaded datasets will be stored in the `raw_datasets` directory (which is gitignored):

## Adding a New Pipeline

<details>
<summary> Click to expand </summary>

OpenBench can be used as a library to evaluate your own diarization, transcription, or orchestration pipelines. The framework supports three types of pipelines:

1. **Diarization Pipeline**: For speaker diarization tasks
2. **Transcription Pipeline**: For ASR/transcription tasks
3. **Orchestration Pipeline**: For combined diarization and transcription tasks

### Creating Your Pipeline

1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `my_pipeline.py`) and implement your pipeline:

```python
from typing import Callable

from openbench.dataset import DiarizationSample
from openbench.types import PipelineType
from openbench.pipeline.base import Pipeline, register_pipeline
from openbench.pipeline.diarization.common import DiarizationOutput, DiarizationPipelineConfig
from openbench.pipeline_prediction import DiarizationAnnotation

@register_pipeline
class MyDiarizationPipeline(Pipeline):
    _config_class = MyDiarizationConfig
    pipeline_type = PipelineType.DIARIZATION

    def build_pipeline(self) -> Callable[[dict], dict]:
        # Initialize your model/function and return a callable
        return my_diarizer_function

    def parse_input(self, input_sample: DiarizationSample) -> dict:
        # Convert DiarizationSample to your model's input format
        return {
            "waveform": input_sample.waveform,
            "sample_rate": input_sample.sample_rate
        }

    def parse_output(self, output: dict) -> DiarizationOutput:
        # Convert your model's output to DiarizationOutput
        return DiarizationOutput(prediction=annotation)
```

2. Create a configuration class for your pipeline:

```python
from pydantic import Field
from openbench.pipeline.diarization.common import DiarizationPipelineConfig

class MyDiarizationConfig(DiarizationPipelineConfig):
    model_path: str = Field(..., description="Path to model weights")
    threshold: float = Field(0.5, description="Detection threshold")
    num_speakers: int | None = Field(None, description="Number of speakers (optional)")
```

3. Create a configuration file for your pipeline:

```yaml
# my_pipeline_config.yaml
out_dir: ./my_pipeline_logs
model_path: /path/to/model
threshold: 0.5
num_speakers: null
```

### Using Your Pipeline

The CLI is currently limited to the pre-implemented pipelines in the library. For custom pipelines, you'll need to use the library directly:

```python
from openbench.runner import BenchmarkConfig, BenchmarkRunner, WandbConfig
from openbench.metric import MetricOptions
from openbench.dataset import DiarizationDatasetConfig

from my_pipeline import MyDiarizationPipeline, MyDiarizationConfig

# Create pipeline configuration
pipeline_config = MyDiarizationConfig(
    model_path="/path/to/model",
    threshold=0.5,
    num_speakers=None,
    out_dir="./my_pipeline_logs"
)

# Create benchmark configuration
benchmark_config = BenchmarkConfig(
    wandb_config=WandbConfig(
        project_name="my-diarization-benchmark",
        run_name="my-pipeline-evaluation",
        tags=["my-pipeline", "evaluation"],
        wandb_mode="online"  # or "offline" for local testing
    ),
    metrics={
        MetricOptions.DER: {},  # Diarization Error Rate
        MetricOptions.JER: {},  # Jaccard Error Rate
    },
    datasets={
        "voxconverse": DiarizationDatasetConfig(
            dataset_id="diarizers-community/voxconverse",
            split="test"
        )
    }
)

# Create pipeline instance
pipeline = MyDiarizationPipeline(pipeline_config)

# Create and run benchmark
runner = BenchmarkRunner(benchmark_config, [pipeline])
benchmark_result = runner.run()

print(benchmark_result.global_results[0])
```

2. For parallel processing, you can configure the number of worker processes in your pipeline config:

```python
pipeline_config = MyDiarizationConfig(
    model_path="/path/to/model",
    threshold=0.5,
    num_speakers=None,
    out_dir="./my_pipeline_logs",
    num_worker_processes=4,  # Number of parallel workers
    per_worker_chunk_size=2  # Samples per worker
)
```

3. To use Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, make sure to:
   - Set up your W&B account and get your API key
   - Make sure you're logged into your W&B account otherwise run `wandb login`
   - Configure the `wandb_config` in your benchmark configuration

The BenchmarkRunner will automatically:
- Run your pipeline on the specified datasets
- Calculate metrics for each sample
- Aggregate results globally
- Log everything to Weights & Biases (if configured)
- Handle parallel processing if enabled (specially interesting for APIs)
- Generate detailed reports and artifacts

### Pipeline Types and Requirements

#### Diarization Pipeline
- Must implement `build_pipeline()`, `parse_input()`, and `parse_output()`
- Input parsing should convert `DiarizationSample` to your model's expected format
- Output parsing should return a `DiarizationOutput` with a `prediction` field

#### Transcription Pipeline
- Must implement `build_pipeline()`, `parse_input()`, and `parse_output()`
- Input parsing should convert `DiarizationSample` to your model's expected format
- Output parsing should return a `TranscriptionOutput` with a `prediction` field

#### Orchestration Pipeline
- Must implement `build_pipeline()`, `parse_input()`, and `parse_output()`
- Can either:
  - Implement end-to-end diarization and transcription
  - Use `PostInferenceMergePipeline` to combine separate diarization and transcription pipelines
- Output parsing should return an `OrchestrationOutput` with a `prediction` field and optionaly `diarization` and `transcription` results

### Running Evaluations with Different Configurations

You can easily customize your evaluation runs using Hydra's override syntax. Here are some common usage patterns:

#### Using the CLI

All Hydra configuration features work with the CLI using `--evaluation-config` and `--evaluation-config-overrides`:

```bash
# Run evaluation with a specific config file
openbench-cli evaluate --evaluation-config config/my_evaluation.yaml

# Override configuration parameters
openbench-cli evaluate \
    --evaluation-config config/my_evaluation.yaml \
    --evaluation-config-overrides wandb.project=my-project pipeline_configs.MyPipeline.config.threshold=0.7

# See the resulting configuration
openbench-cli evaluate --evaluation-config config/my_evaluation.yaml --help
```

#### Using the evaluation.py script provided in the repo (old-way)

1. **Selecting Specific Pipelines**
```bash
# Run evaluation with only MyPipeline
uv run python evaluation.py pipeline_configs=my_pipeline
```

2. **Modifying Pipeline Parameters**
You can override specific configuration parameters in two ways:

a. **Override by Value**:
```bash
# Change the speaker segmenter stride
uv run python evaluation.py \
    pipeline_configs=my_pipeline \
    pipeline_configs.MyPipeline.config.diarization_config.speaker_segmenter_config.variant_name=stride_2
```

b. **Override by Config**:
```bash
# Use a predefined speaker segmenter configuration
uv run python evaluation.py \
    pipeline_configs=my_pipeline \
    pipeline_configs/MyPipeline/config/diarization_config/speaker_segmenter_config=stride_2
```

Note: Use `-h` flag with any command to see the resulting configuration:
```bash
uv run python evaluation.py pipeline_configs=my_pipeline -h
```
